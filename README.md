### ðŸ“¤ Uploading and ðŸ“¥ Downloading Files in ZGDrive

#### Uploading a File
Navigate to the Cloud Tab. This is where you can upload files to the decentralized 0G storage network.

#### Uploading a File
Choose the file you want to upload. Once you initiate the upload, ZGDrive breaks down your file into chunks and securely distributes them across 0Gâ€™s decentralized nodes. During this process, youâ€™ll see the file in the upload queue.

#### Downloading a File
File in Download Queue
Once you request to download a file from the cloud, it will appear in the download queue. ZGDrive retrieves the file from 0Gâ€™s decentralized nodes, reassembling the chunks using the Merkle root hash to ensure data integrity.

#### File in Local Tab After Download Completion
After the download is complete, the file will appear in the Local tab. This means itâ€™s fully downloaded and ready for you to access offline. ZGDrive ensures your data is intact and accessible, thanks to the decentralized storage network. The file will be available in local till the expiry time (Default: 1 Hour) and then the background process will clean up the local files to save space. Your file is safe on the 0g storage network to get on your command

#### End-to-End Decentralized Storage Workflow
With ZGDrive, the upload and download process is fully decentralized, ensuring that your data is securely stored and retrievable without a centralized intermediary. By splitting and distributing files across multiple nodes and retrieving them as needed, ZGDrive delivers privacy, control, and resilience for your data.
